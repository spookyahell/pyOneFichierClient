# pyOneFichierClient

This is a library designed for easy interaction with the [1Fichier API](https://1fichier.com/api.html)

## Usage

If you're interested in how to use it in your own project you can have a look at [test_cli.py](test_cli.py)
<br /> which also functions as a nice executable module...

You can install it from PyPI! [pyOneFichierClient on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyOneFichierClient/)
<br />`pip install pyOneFichierClient`
<br />Spread the word! On Twitter and all the other shitty places on this thing we like calling internet.

Just need to be in the parent dir of the entire project and run `python -m pyOneFichierClient` and the interactive client will launch...

If you want to know what you can already do with this version of the API, you can also check out [API Endpoints](TODO.md#api-endpoints)

## Recomendation
Do not update on Friday - Sunday because that are times when I am mainly working on this... if you do beware there can be (not that it's planned) so called forced updates which could screw up your updating...
<br />I will try to leave a message in the README (right here) whenever I do not plan on working on the API and it's okay to update it...

<em>Update April 21st 2024: Updates have been stale and project sorta unmaintained but I just created three real issues that I hope to tackle soon. I'd recommend you don't update until all three have been closed out.</em>
