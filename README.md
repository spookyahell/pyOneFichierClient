# pyOneFichierClient

This is a library designed for easy interaction with the [1Fichier API](https://1fichier.com/api.html)

## Usage

If you're interested in how to use it in your own project you can have a look at [test_cli.py](test_cli.py)
<br /> which also functions as a nice executable module...

You can install it from PyPI! [pyOneFichierClient on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyOneFichierClient/)
<br />`pip install pyOneFichierClient`
<br />Spread the word! On Twitter and all the other shitty places on this thing we like calling internet.

Just need to be in the parent dir of the entire project and run `python -m pyOneFichierClient` and the interactive client will launch...

If you want to know what you can already do with this version of the API, you can also check out [API Endpoints](TODO.md#api-endpoints)

## Note regarding PFUs
I don't use git often and I haven't with this project in quite a while.
<br>Beware of forced pushes. (possible forced updates - PFU)
<br>They can and will happen.

## Updates to the project
- <em>Update April 21st 2024: Updates have been stale and project sorta unmaintained but I just created three real issues that I hope to tackle soon. I'd recommend you don't update until all three have been closed out.</em>
- <em>Update September 24th 2024: Updates still as stale as ever. Might be getting somewhere soon?
<br>But not sure. Check [issues](https://github.com/spookyahell/pyOneFichierClient/issues) for scheduled changes.</em>
